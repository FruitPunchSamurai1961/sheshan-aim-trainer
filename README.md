# Sheshan's Aim Trainer-Video Game

A multi-level game I made using pygame. It has three levels of varying difficulty.

## Getting Started

Just copy the source code or download the files and the images.

### Prerequisites

You need to have python installed and the pygame library in order to play this game


### Installing

1. Open the folder and go, in your command terminal into the directory and istall pygame

```
pip install pygame
```

2. You will need to make sure that your python path or sys can go into the other folders otherwise, the other games will not run. To learn how to do this, please refer to the following sites:

3. All the code is loaded, so just run the main-screen file

```

```
